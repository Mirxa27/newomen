# Landing Page Access Fix

## Problem
The application was redirecting visitors directly to the authentication page (`/auth`) instead of showing the landing page. This prevented visitors from accessing public pages without signing up.

## Solution
The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Header Component**: Updated `useUserProfile` hook in the Header component to use `{ redirectToAuth: false }` option to prevent automatic redirects to the auth page.

```tsx
// Before
const { profile, loading: profileLoading, getDisplayName } = useUserProfile();

// After
const { profile, loading: profileLoading, getDisplayName } = useUserProfile({ redirectToAuth: false });
```

2. **Navigation Buttons**: Updated all navigation buttons to correctly point to `/auth` for sign-in/sign-up actions while keeping the landing page as the home page (`/`).

3. **Protected Route Component**: Ensured the ProtectedRoute component redirects to `/auth` when a user is not authenticated, rather than redirecting to the landing page.

```tsx
// Before
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
}

// After
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/auth" replace />;
}
```

## Results
- Visitors can now access the landing page (`/`) without being redirected to authentication
- Public routes like `/about`, `/pricing`, `/terms-of-service`, `/privacy-policy`, and `/assessments` are accessible without authentication
- Protected routes still require authentication and redirect to `/auth` when needed
- The navigation flow is now more intuitive, with clear paths for both visitors and authenticated users

## Deployment
The changes have been deployed to production. The build was successful and the changes are now live.
