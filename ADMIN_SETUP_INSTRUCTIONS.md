# Admin Panel Setup Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The admin panel was inaccessible due to missing database schema and authentication logic issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- Added `role` column to `user_profiles` table with values: 'user', 'admin', 'moderator'
- Updated RLS policies to support role-based admin access
- Modified `handle_new_user()` function to auto-assign admin role for admin@newomen.me

### 2. Frontend Fixes
- Fixed missing `Brain` icon import in Admin.tsx
- Enhanced `useAdmin` hook with fallback authentication methods
- Improved error handling and loading states

## Production Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fkikaozubngmzcrnhkqe
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `admin_fix_production.sql` file

### Step 2: Create Admin User
You have two options:

#### Option A: Sign up through the app with admin email
1. Go to https://newomen-h35jfehiu-mirxa27s-projects.vercel.app/auth
2. Sign up with email: `admin@newomen.me`
3. Use a secure password
4. The system will automatically assign admin role

#### Option B: Create admin user in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click "Add User"
3. Email: `admin@newomen.me`
4. Set a secure password
5. The role will be automatically assigned via the trigger function

### Step 3: Verify Admin Access
1. Sign in with admin@newomen.me
2. Navigate to `/admin` or click Admin in the navigation
3. You should see the full admin dashboard with all tabs:
   - AI Builder
   - Providers
   - AI Providers
   - AI Assessments
   - AI Config
   - Prompts
   - Live Sessions
   - History
   - Content Management
   - User Management
   - Analytics

## Admin Panel Features

The admin panel now includes:
- **AI Content Builder**: Generate assessments, courses, and explorations
- **Provider Management**: Manage service providers
- **AI Provider Management**: Configure AI service providers
- **AI Assessment Management**: Manage AI-powered assessments
- **AI Configuration**: Configure AI settings
- **AI Prompting**: Manage AI prompts and templates
- **Live Sessions**: Monitor active user sessions
- **Session History**: View session analytics
- **Content Management**: Manage platform content
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts and roles
- **Analytics**: View platform analytics and metrics

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Only users with 'admin' role can access admin panel
- **Email-based Fallback**: admin@newomen.me always has admin access regardless of role column
- **Row Level Security**: All admin operations are protected by RLS policies
- **Secure Authentication**: Admin routes are protected by both authentication and authorization

## Troubleshooting

### If admin access is still not working:

1. **Check user role in database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, email, role FROM user_profiles 
   JOIN auth.users ON user_profiles.user_id = auth.users.id 
   WHERE email = 'admin@newomen.me';
   ```

2. **Manually set admin role**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@newomen.me');
   ```

3. **Check RLS policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles';
   ```

4. **Clear browser cache and cookies** for the site

5. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Frontend deployed to Vercel: https://newomen-h35jfehiu-mirxa27s-projects.vercel.app
- ⚠️ Database migration needs to be applied manually in Supabase Dashboard
- ⚠️ Admin user needs to be created (see steps above)

## Next Steps
1. Apply the database migration from `admin_fix_production.sql`
2. Create the admin user account
3. Test admin panel access
4. Verify all admin functions work correctly
5. Set up proper admin email and credentials for production use
