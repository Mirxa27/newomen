## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Problem Identified
The code was attempting to query `challenge_templates` as a foreign key relationship from `couples_challenges`, which doesn't exist in the database schema.

### Solution Implemented
Changed the data access pattern to extract template information directly from the `question_set` JSONB column in the `couples_challenges` table.

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
.select("*, challenge_templates(*)")  // ❌ Foreign key doesn't exist
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
.select("*")
// Extract template from question_set JSONB field
const template = challenge.question_set;
```

### Files Modified
1. `src/pages/CouplesChallenge.tsx` - Frontend component
2. `supabase/functions/couples-challenge-analyzer/index.ts` - Edge function
