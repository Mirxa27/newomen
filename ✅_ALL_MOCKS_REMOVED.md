# ✅ ALL MOCK DATA REMOVED - 100% REAL

## 🗑️ **DELETED FILES**

### Mock Data Files Completely Removed:
1. ❌ `src/data/memberAssessments.ts` - **DELETED** (20 fake assessments)
2. ❌ `src/data/publicAssessments.ts` - **DELETED** (2 fake assessments)

**Result:** `src/data/` directory is now **empty**

---

## ✅ **UPDATED TO USE REAL DATA**

### Pages Now Using Supabase (100% Real):

#### 1. **MemberAssessments.tsx**
**Before:**
```typescript
import { memberAssessments } from "@/data/memberAssessments";
// Used hardcoded array of 20 fake assessments
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("assessments_enhanced")
  .select("*")
  .eq("is_active", true)
  .eq("is_public", true)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

setAssessments(data); // Real assessments from database
```

#### 2. **PublicAssessments.tsx**
**Before:**
```typescript
import { publicAssessments } from "@/data/publicAssessments";
// Used hardcoded array of 2 fake assessments
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("assessments_enhanced")
  .select("*")
  .eq("is_active", true)
  .eq("is_public", true)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

## 📁 **REMAINING HARDCODED DATA (Intentional)**

### Static Marketing Content Only:

1. **Landing.tsx**
   - Features list (for marketing)
   - Pricing tiers display
   - Testimonials
   - **Purpose:** Static marketing page

2. **Pricing.tsx**
   - Subscription tiers
   - Feature lists per tier
   - **Purpose:** Public pricing page

3. **WellnessLibrary.tsx**
   - Category filters (meditation, breathing, etc.)
   - **Purpose:** UI filter options

**These are NOT mocks** - they're intentional static UI content.
