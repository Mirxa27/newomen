| Size (px) | Usage | Required |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1024x1024 | App Store | ✅ Yes |
| 180x180 | iPhone @3x | ✅ Yes |

| 76x76 | iPad | If iPad |

### 1. Create App Icons

**Using existing logo** (`public/Newomen logo.svg`):

```bash
# Install imagemagick if not installed
brew install imagemagick

# Create icons directory
mkdir -p ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset

# Generate icons (example - adjust paths as needed)
# You'll need to export your SVG to PNG first at high resolution (2048x2048)
# Then resize:

convert logo-2048.png -resize 1024x1024 icon-1024.png
convert logo-2048.png -resize 180x180 icon-180.png
convert logo-2048.png -resize 120x120 icon-120.png
convert logo-2048.png -resize 167x167 icon-167.png
convert logo-2048.png -resize 152x152 icon-152.png
convert logo-2048.png -resize 76x76 icon-76.png
```

**Or use online tool**:

### 2. Add Icons to Xcode

1. Open `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`

3. Ensure "App Store iOS" 1024x1024 icon is included
