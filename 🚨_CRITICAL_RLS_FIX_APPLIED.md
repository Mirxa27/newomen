# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RLS INFINITE RECURSION FIX - APPLIED âœ…

## Problem Solved
**Fixed the infinite recursion error in `user_profiles` RLS policies that was causing 500 Internal Server Errors**

## What Was Wrong
The RLS policies were trying to query `user_profiles.role` within the policy itself, creating a circular dependency:

```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC (caused recursion):
SELECT user_profiles_1.role 
FROM user_profiles user_profiles_1 
WHERE user_profiles_1.user_id = auth.uid()
```

## Solution Applied
Replaced recursive policies with direct email-based admin checks using `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'`:

### New user_profiles Policies:
- âœ… `user_read_own` - Users can read their own profile
- âœ… `user_update_own` - Users can update their own profile  
- âœ… `user_insert_own` - Users can insert their profile on signup
- âœ… `admin_read_all` - Admins can read all profiles (email-based)
- âœ… `admin_update_all` - Admins can update all profiles (email-based)

### New wellness_resources Policies:
- âœ… `wellness_public_read` - Public read access to active resources
- âœ… `wellness_admin_all` - Admin full access to resources (email-based)

## Admin Emails Configured:
- `admin@newomen.me`
- `katerina@newomen.me` 
- `Abdullah@sourcekom.com`

## Verification Results:
âœ… Database queries now work without recursion errors
âœ… user_profiles table accessible 
âœ… wellness_resources table accessible
âœ… Admin access properly configured

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…
The application should now load without the "infinite recursion detected" errors.
