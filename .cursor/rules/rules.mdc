# Development Rules

## Core Principles
- Use agentic skills and MCP tools for implementation and execution
- Never hallucinate or create placeholder content
- Build against real services and data only

## Strict Development Standards

### 1. Real Implementation Only
- No mocks, stubs, or simulated functionality
- Build against actual services and data sources
- Only use placeholders when third-party services are completely unavailable

### 2. Production-Ready Delivery
- Deliver complete, fully functional features
- No partial implementations or "TODO" placeholders
- Every feature must be production-ready

### 3. Accuracy and Verification
- All code, comments, and documentation must be accurate and verifiable
- No assumptions or unverified claims
- Every statement must be necessary and truthful

### 4. Single-Source File Management
- Never create duplicate files
- Avoid labels like "enhanced", "updated", "v2"
- Always modify the original file in place

### 5. Latest Dependencies
- Use MCP Context 7 to install/upgrade packages to latest stable versions
- Keep dependencies current and secure

### 6. Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code
