# Next Steps - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration
Run the new migration to add the narrative identity data column:

```bash
supabase migration up
```

Or if using Supabase CLI locally:
```bash
cd /workspaces/new-mind-nexus
supabase db push
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket for Avatars
Via Supabase Dashboard or CLI:

**Dashboard:**
1. Go to Storage → Create Bucket
2. Bucket name: `avatars`
3. Public bucket: `true`
4. File size limit: 5MB
5. Allowed MIME types: `image/png, image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/webp`

**CLI:**
```bash
supabase storage create avatars --public
```

Then set RLS policies:
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING ( bucket_id = 'avatars' );

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK ( 
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING ( 
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatar
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING ( 
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 3. Enhance AI Content Builder Edge Function
Update `/supabase/functions/ai-content-builder/index.ts` to handle narrative analysis:

```typescript
// Add this case to the existing function
case 'narrative-identity-analysis':
  const prompt = `Analyze this personal narrative and extract:
  
1. Core Themes: 3-5 recurring themes across all answers
2. Limiting Beliefs: 2-4 beliefs that may be holding them back
3. Strength Patterns: 3-5 demonstrated strengths/capabilities
4. Transformation Opportunities: 3-4 growth areas
5. Personality Archetype: Choose one: Explorer, Healer, Builder, Warrior, Sage, Caregiver
6. Narrative Coherence: 0-100 score of story consistency
7. Transformation Roadmap: 4-5 specific, actionable steps with titles, descriptions, and action items

Context:
${body.context}

Return JSON only.`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    response_format: { type: 'json_object' }
  });
  
  return new Response(response.choices[0].message.content);
```

### 4. Test the Complete Flow

#### A. Test Narrative Identity Exploration
1. Navigate to `/narrative-exploration`
2. Answer all 10 questions (minimum 50 characters each)
3. Verify AI analysis completes successfully
4. Check results dashboard displays properly
5. Verify data saved to `user_memory_profiles.narrative_identity_data`

#### B. Test Profile Page
1. Navigate to `/profile`
2. Upload avatar (test with < 5MB image)
3. Verify image appears in UI
4. Edit nickname and save
5. Check achievements display
6. Verify progress tracking shows correct level/crystals

#### C. Test Community Features
1. Navigate to `/community`
2. Search for users
3. Send connection request
4. Accept/decline requests
5. Verify connection status updates

#### D. Test Wellness Library
1. Navigate to `/wellness-library`
2. Filter by category
3. Search for resources
4. Test audio player (if audio URLs available)
5. Download a resource

### 5. Optional: Add Real Audio Resources
Replace placeholder URLs in `WellnessLibrary.tsx` or add to database:

```sql
-- Example: Insert real wellness resources
INSERT INTO wellness_resources (title, description, category, duration, audio_url, thumbnail_url)
VALUES 
  ('Morning Meditation', 'Start your day centered', 'meditation', 600, 'https://your-cdn.com/morning.mp3', 'https://your-cdn.com/thumb1.jpg'),
  ('Breathing Exercise', '4-7-8 breath technique', 'breathing', 300, 'https://your-cdn.com/breathing.mp3', 'https://your-cdn.com/thumb2.jpg');
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
The errors you see are false positives - modules exist but TS server hasn't indexed them. To fix:
```bash
# Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

# Or rebuild
bun run build
```

### Supabase Connection Issues
Check environment variables in `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Avatar Upload Fails
1. Verify storage bucket exists
2. Check RLS policies allow uploads
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Check file size < 5MB

### AI Analysis Fails
1. Verify edge function is deployed
2. Check OpenAI API key is set
3. Verify function logs: `supabase functions logs ai-content-builder`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
bun run build
```

### Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-content-builder
supabase functions deploy realtime-token
```

### Environment Variables (Production)
Set in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. Narrative Exploration completion rate
2. Avatar upload success rate
3. Community connection activity
4. Wellness resource engagement
5. AI analysis response times

### Database Queries for Insights
```sql
-- Count completed narrative explorations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_memory_profiles 
WHERE narrative_identity_data IS NOT NULL;

-- Most popular wellness resources
SELECT title, COUNT(*) as plays 
FROM wellness_resource_plays 
GROUP BY title 
ORDER BY plays DESC;

-- Community connection growth
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*) 
FROM community_connections 
WHERE status = 'connected'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

## 🎨 Design Customization

All pages use the liquid glassmorphism theme. To customize:

### Colors (tailwind.config.ts)
```typescript
colors: {
  primary: {...},  // Purple accent
  accent: {...},   // Pink accent
}
```

### Glass Effect (index.css)
```css
.glass-card {
  backdrop-filter: blur(16px);
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```
