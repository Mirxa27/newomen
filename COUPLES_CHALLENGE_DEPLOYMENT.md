## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema (Verified)
```sql
-- couples_challenges structure:
- id: uuid (primary key)
- initiator_id: uuid (foreign key to user_profiles)
- partner_id: uuid (foreign key to user_profiles)
- status: text (pending/in_progress/completed/analyzed)
- question_set: jsonb (contains template data directly)
- responses: jsonb (contains both partners' answers)
- analysis: jsonb (AI-generated analysis)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

### Key Fix Applied
**Problem:** The code was trying to join `challenge_templates` as a foreign key, which doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Extract template data directly from the `question_set` JSONB column:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
.select("*, challenge_templates(*)")

// After (CORRECT):
.select("*")
// Then extract: const template = challenge.question_set;
```

### AI Integration
- **Provider:** Z.ai
- **Model:** GLM-4-Flash
- **Endpoint:** `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
- **Usage:** Analyzes couple responses and generates insights
