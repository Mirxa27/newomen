SET ai_model = 'gpt-4o-mini'
WHERE name = 'Default Assessment Analyzer';

-- Or use Claude 3 (when available)
UPDATE ai_assessment_configs
SET 
  ai_provider = 'anthropic',
  ai_model = 'claude-3-opus-20240229'
WHERE name = 'Default Assessment Analyzer';
```

### **Customize System Prompt:**

```sql
UPDATE ai_assessment_configs
SET system_prompt = 'Your custom prompt...

## 📊 **MONITORING & ANALYTICS**

### **Check AI Usage:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as assessments_processed,
  SUM(tokens_used) as total_tokens,
  SUM(cost_usd) as total_cost,
  AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_processing_time
FROM ai_usage_logs
WHERE success = true
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### **View User Progress:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  up.assessment_id,
  a.title,
  up.best_score,
  up.total_attempts,
  up.is_completed,
  up.completion_date
FROM user_assessment_progress up
JOIN user_profiles up2 ON up.user_id = up2.user_id
JOIN auth.users u ON up2.user_id = u.id
JOIN assessments_enhanced a ON up.assessment_id = a.id
ORDER BY up.last_attempt_at DESC;
```

### **Check Assessment Performance:**
```sql
SELECT 
  a.title,
  COUNT(aa.id) as total_attempts,
  AVG(aa.ai_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN aa.ai_score >= a.passing_score THEN 1 END) as passed_count
FROM assessments_enhanced a
LEFT JOIN assessment_attempts aa ON a.id = aa.assessment_id
WHERE aa.is_ai_processed = true
GROUP BY a.id, a.title
ORDER BY total_attempts DESC;
```
