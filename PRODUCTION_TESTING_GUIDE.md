# Expected: {"version":"...","health":"ok"}
```

**Edge Functions:**
```bash
# Test realtime-token
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/realtime-token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with token
```

**Database Queries:**
```bash
# Test public table access
curl https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/wellness_resources?select=*&limit=5 \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Expected: Array of wellness resources
```

### Performance Tests

**Use Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools):**

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Navigate to Lighthouse tab
3. Select "Performance" category
4. Click "Analyze page load"

**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] Performance Score > 80
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- [ ] Total Blocking Time < 200ms
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1

**Use WebPageTest (https://www.webpagetest.org/):**

1. Enter your production URL
2. Select test location closest to users
3. Run test

**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] Start Render < 1.5s
- [ ] Speed Index < 3.0s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3.5s

### Security Tests

**SSL/HTTPS:**
```bash
# Check SSL certificate
curl -I https://mirxa.io

# Expected: HTTP/2 200
```

**Headers:**
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://mirxa.io | grep -i "content-security-policy\|x-frame-options\|strict-transport-security"

# Expected: Security headers present
```

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Try to access another user's data (should fail)
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id != auth.uid();

-- Expected: Empty result (RLS blocks access)
```

### Load Tests (Optional but Recommended)

**Use Artillery (https://www.artillery.io/):**

```yaml
# load-test.yml
config:
  target: "https://mirxa.io"
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 10
scenarios:
  - name: "Homepage Load"
    flow:
      - get:
          url: "/"
```

Run: `npx artillery run load-test.yml`

**Target Metrics:**
- [ ] Response time p95 < 500ms
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Successful requests > 99%

# Install Playwright
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test

# Run tests
npx playwright test
```

### E2E Tests

```typescript
// tests/auth.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user can sign up and login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/auth');
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
});
```
