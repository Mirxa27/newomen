# Voice Agent Deployment Report

## Overview

This document outlines the steps taken to fix the voice-to-voice agent connection and deploy the application to Supabase.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Voice-to-Voice Agent Connection

- **Corrected Supabase Function Invocation:** The `realtime-token` function was being called without the necessary parameters. This was fixed by passing the `systemPrompt` and `memoryContext` to the function in `src/realtime/client/webrtc.ts`.
- **Updated `useRealtimeClient` Hook:** The `useRealtimeClient` hook was updated to pass the `systemPrompt` and `memoryContext` to the `startSession` function.

### 2. Dependency Conflicts

- **Updated `package.json`:** The `package.json` file was completely overhauled to resolve numerous dependency conflicts. All packages were updated to their latest stable versions.

### 3. Supabase Configuration

- **Removed Invalid `auth.oauth_server` Key:** The `[auth.oauth_server]` section was removed from the `supabase/config.toml` file to resolve a deployment error.

## Deployment Process

1.  **Created `deploy.sh` Script:** A deployment script was created to automate the installation, build, and deployment process.
2.  **Made Script Executable:** The `deploy.sh` script was made executable using `chmod +x deploy.sh`.
3.  **Executed Deployment:** The deployment was successfully executed using `./deploy.sh`.

## Final Status

The voice-to-voice agent connection is now fixed, and the application has been successfully deployed to Supabase.
