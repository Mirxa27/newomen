# Voice Agent Deployment Report

This document outlines the steps taken to fix the voice-to-voice agent connection and deploy the application to Supabase.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Voice-to-Voice Agent Connection

- **Fixed WebSocket Connection:** The `realtime-token` function was updated to return the correct WebSocket URL format (`wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`) for OpenAI Realtime API.
- **Updated WebRTC Client:** Modified `src/realtime/client/webrtc.ts` to properly connect to OpenAI's Realtime API using the correct WebSocket protocol and session configuration.
- **Fixed Session Configuration:** Updated both WebRTC and WebSocket fallback clients to send proper session configuration messages to OpenAI Realtime API after connection opens.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved error handling and connection state management in both client implementations.

### 2. Dependency Conflicts

- **Updated `package.json`:** Fixed major dependency version conflicts by updating React, TypeScript, Vite, ESLint, and other core dependencies to compatible versions.
- **Resolved Build Issues:** Fixed PostCSS configuration issues and CSS linting problems.

### 3. Supabase Configuration

- **Applied Database Migrations:** Successfully applied pending database migrations including admin premium system and advanced therapy assessments.
- **Deployed Edge Functions:** All voice agent functions (`realtime-token`, `ai-content-builder`, `gamification-engine`) are deployed and accessible.

## Deployment Process

1. **Fixed Dependency Issues:** Updated package versions to resolve conflicts and ensure compatibility.
2. **Built Application:** Successfully built the React application with all dependencies.
3. **Deployed Edge Functions:** Deployed all voice agent functions to Supabase project `fkikaozubngmzcrnhkqe`.
4. **Applied Database Migrations:** Applied pending migrations including admin premium system and advanced therapy categories.

## Final Status

The voice-to-voice agent connection is now fixed, and the application has been successfully deployed to Supabase with all voice chat functionality working properly.

## Testing Voice Chat

1. **Navigate to Voice Chat:** Go to `/chat/realtime` in your deployed application
2. **Grant Permissions:** Allow microphone access when prompted
3. **Start Session:** Click "Start Session" button
4. **Speak Naturally:** The AI should respond with voice and real-time transcripts

## API Endpoints

- **Realtime Token Function:** `https://fkikaozubngmzcrnhkqe.supabase.co/functions/v1/realtime-token`
- **Supabase Project:** `fkikaozubngmzcrnhkqe`
- **OpenAI Integration:** Configured with proper API key and session management

## Technical Implementation

### WebRTC Client (`src/realtime/client/webrtc.ts`)
- Establishes WebSocket connection to OpenAI Realtime API
- Handles audio input from microphone
- Processes real-time transcript responses
- Manages connection state and error handling

### Edge Function (`supabase/functions/realtime-token/index.ts`)
- Authenticates users via Supabase Auth
- Generates ephemeral OpenAI Realtime API tokens
- Returns proper WebSocket URL and session configuration
- Logs session creation for monitoring

### Voice Chat Page (`src/pages/RealtimeChatPage.tsx`)
- Provides user interface for voice chat sessions
- Shows real-time transcripts and audio levels
- Handles device selection and session controls
- Displays connection status and error messages
