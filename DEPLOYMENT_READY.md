## 🎯 Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Git Push:** Changes are already pushed to `main` branch
2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy:** Will trigger automatically
3. **Build Process:** Vercel runs `npm run build`
4. **Deployment:** Automatic rollout with zero downtime

### Manual Deployment (If Needed)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or deploy with environment check
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run verification script
./verify-deployment.sh

# Check deployment status
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

#### 1. Check Build Logs
```bash
# View recent logs
vercel logs

# Check specific deployment
vercel logs [deployment-id]
```

#### 2. Verify Environment Variables
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Ensure all required variables are set
- Variables must be set for Production environment

#### 3. Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Build fails with TypeScript errors**
```bash
# Solution: Run local type check
npx tsc --noEmit
# Fix any errors before deploying
```

**Issue: Missing environment variables**
```bash
# Solution: Add in Vercel dashboard or use CLI
vercel env add VARIABLE_NAME production
```

**Issue: Build timeout**
```bash
# Solution: Contact Vercel support or upgrade plan
# Or optimize build by code splitting
```

**Issue: Deployment successful but app not working**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URLs are correct (not localhost)
- Check network requests for API errors
- Verify RLS policies allow public access where needed

## 💡 Tips for Future Deployments

### Best Practices
1. **Always test locally first:** `npm run build && npm run preview`
2. **Use feature branches:** Deploy previews before merging to main
3. **Check dependencies:** Keep packages updated and secure
4. **Monitor bundle size:** Use tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
5. **Test across browsers:** Ensure compatibility
6. **Use environment variables:** Never hardcode secrets
7. **Enable error tracking:** Set up Sentry or similar
8. **Document changes:** Update README and changelog

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature

# Vercel creates preview deployment automatically
# Test the preview URL
# Merge PR when ready

# Main branch auto-deploys to production
```
